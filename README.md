# yii2-widgets

I use a common folder in my yii2 env named 'system'.

You will have to properly namespace the components you choose to use.

I included all the linked components in this repo, but they were pulled from various other namespaces inside my env.

I hope I properly namespaced them all.
If not, might get errors which shuld be fixed by checking the namespaces of the used components.
